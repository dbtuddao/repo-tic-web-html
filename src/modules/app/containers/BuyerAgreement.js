            <h2>Service</h2>
            <p>
              Through its online digital platform (the "<strong>Platform</strong>"), TicketSwap offers a service that allows you to buy and sell e-tickets for events (such as concerts, parties, and festivals) (the "<strong>Service</strong>").
            </p>

            <h2>Registration and privacy</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Sales of e-tickets</h2>
            <h3>Uploading e-tickets</h3>
            <p>
              As "<strong>Seller</strong>" you can offer an e-ticket for sale on the platform by uploading a PDF file of the e-ticket. The file must be the original digital version that is provided by the ticket provider and the Seller must be authorized to sell the e-ticket. Scanned e-tickets, photos of e-tickets, or custom files are not allowed. The Seller may withdraw his/her offer to sell uploaded e-tickets at any time, as long as the e-ticket is still available.
            </p>
            <p>
              To avoid doubt: once the offer is accepted by the Buyer, a final agreement will be concluded with the Buyer, and the Seller may no longer withdraw his/her offer. TicketSwap is only the provider of the service and not party to the agreement between Buyer and Seller.
            </p>

            <h3>Description e-ticket</h3>
            <p>
              The Seller fills in the information on the e-ticket as completely and truthfully as possible. Such information shall include at least the name of the event, the price (including service charge), and the personal bank account number of the Seller. The bank account number must be from one of the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. If it concerns seat or box number e-tickets, these numbers should be mentioned clearly in the "description" field. TicketSwap reserves the right to change the information on a provided e-ticket to any information contained in the uploaded e-ticket.
            </p>

            <h3>Cost and Price</h3>
            <p>
              The Seller determines the selling price of each e-ticket that he/she offers on the Platform (the "<strong>Sale</strong>"), provided that this price does not exceed 120% of the original price (including service) of the e-ticket. For each e-ticket for which a purchase agreement is concluded, the Seller is due an amount equal to 5% of the Sales Price (incl. VAT) (the "Service Charge") to TicketSwap. Payment of this amount is settled by means of setoff, and the Seller will therefore receive 95% of the Sales Price.
            </p>

            <h3>VAT</h3>
            <p>
              The VAT on the tickets that the Seller sells via TicketSwap must have already been paid on the original e-ticket before the Seller offers the e-ticket for sale. TicketSwap will charge VAT on the transaction costs of the buyer and on the agency fee of the Seller.
            </p>

            <h3>Sold e-tickets</h3>
            <p>
              The Seller receives an e-mail with an attachment when a sale has been made, and the sold ticket is automatically removed from the platform. The Seller should check that the e-ticket is indicated as sold on the TicketSwap website. The Seller is obliged to destroy all duplicates of the sold ticket.
            </p>

            <h3>Payment to Seller</h3>
            <p>
              After the sale and delivery of e-tickets, the Seller receives the agreed Sales Price minus the Service Charge as soon as possible. TicketSwap acts as cashier for Buyer and Seller, but is not a party to the agreement between Buyer and Seller.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sellers that have sold e-tickets or still have e-tickets for sale for events that have not yet occurred (hereinafter "<strong>Uncertain Value</strong>") exceeding the value of €400 at any given time, are not paid until after the event. TicketSwap reserves the Uncertain Value for the Seller. TicketSwap makes use of a third party account.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a seller has an outstanding amount of Uncertain Value exceeding €400, a confirmation is always requested before a newly listed e-ticket will be put up for sale. For more information on Uncertain Value, please <a href="#modal-potential-risk-info" data-toggle="modal">see this link</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              TicketSwap reserves the right to reverse the sale of an e-ticket if the conditions of this User Agreement are not fulfilled.
            </p>

The transaction costs for the purchase of an e-ticket amount to 5% of the selling price and include the cost of the payment and VAT. Extra costs will be charged for a number of payment methods. After purchase, the e-ticket is downloadable directly from the Platform. Additionally, after payment TicketSwap supplies the e-ticket in the form of a link to the PDF file by e-mail, as soon as possible. A final agreement between the Seller and the Buyer is concluded at that time. Due to the nature of the product, it is not possible to undo the purchase.
